# Ablation: Double Quantization Effect
# Compare NF4 with and without double quantization

name: ablation_double_quant
description: "Ablation study: effect of double quantization"

experiments:
  - name: bnb_4bit_nf4_double
    quantization:
      method: bnb_4bit
      bnb_4bit_quant_type: nf4
      bnb_4bit_use_double_quant: true
    
  - name: bnb_4bit_nf4_no_double
    quantization:
      method: bnb_4bit
      bnb_4bit_quant_type: nf4
      bnb_4bit_use_double_quant: false

# Expected result: Double quant saves ~0.4 bits/param with minimal accuracy loss
